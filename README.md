This is a **Next.js fullstack project** with API routes for managing medications.

### Getting Started

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Session Behavior Note

The app uses localStorage to store the logged-in user session. Logging in as a different user in a new tab will overwrite the previous session and log out the first user. This is expected behavior.
